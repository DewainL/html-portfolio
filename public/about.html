<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>
  Hey there! I'm an aspiring web developer from Houston, Texas, currently diving
  deep into the foundations of front-end development. I'm learning HTML, CSS,
  JavaScript, and React through Angela Yu's highly-rated Udemy course, and I'm
  building real-world projects to sharpen my skills and showcase what I can do.
</p>

<p>
  Before tech, I built a well-rounded career across the food, oil & gas, and
  customer service industriesâ€”where I developed strong problem-solving,
  communication, and adaptability skills. I'm also a certified soccer referee
  with regional tournament experience and a former collegiate and UPSL
  semi-professional soccer player.
</p>

<p>
  My goal is to bring my diverse background and work ethic into the tech world,
  creating clean, user-friendly websites that make a difference. I'm excited to
  keep growing, collaborating, and contributing to real projects as I level up
  in web development.
